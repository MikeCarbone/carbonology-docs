In an effort to further close the gap between designers and developers, we're happy to announce that Arcade has partnered with Adobe and will be supporting the Design System Package (DSP) file format upon release.

It's an honor to join the Customer Advisory Board with other innovative teams such as the Google Material Design team, Microsoft, Knapsack, Specify and others, and we're excited to collaborate with Demian Borba and the rest of the Adobe team to make inter-tool design communication a reality. By managing your tokens in Arcade, you'll be able to export your tokens to a tokens.json file, [allowing seamless imports into your DSP](https://github.com/AdobeXD/design-system-package-dsp#datatokensjson).

With Arcade, it doesn't matter who is making what changes whereâ€” your design decisions will live in one place, as one source of truth. Arcade's decision-context schema will enable your team to keep in sync and build better products, faster. By supporting DSP, teams can now funnel Arcade's unique context data into the DSP with ease.

In addition to DSP, Arcade will be supporting numerous outputs right out of the box. With our custom Arcade Engine under the hood, we're able to build these exports with ease. And that's kind of our thing. As we keep building, we'll be forming more partnerships to understand how best to serve the community's needs. And with the power of our Engine, many new export formats are to come.

So thank you, Adobe! We're excited to see how the community will use Arcade and the DSP export to better their workflow, and further bridge the gap between designers and developers.
